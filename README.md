Environment that can simulate Hearthstone Barrens Mystery (Hunter)

for finding a right trajectory in the Mystery Game

This was originally finding the correct method using reinforcement learning based approach,

but failed due to sparcity of the reward and very limited number of trajectory.

so I am just leaving only the environment for someone that might need this in the future.
